# GEML vs. other markup formats

*English | [中文](./matrix-cn.md)*

How GEML compares to **Markdown** (GitHub-flavored), **HTML**, **CommonMark**
(strict core), **AsciiDoc**, **Org-mode**, and **Pandoc Markdown**.

Note on Pandoc: it is really a *converter* plus its own **Pandoc Markdown** —
the most feature-complete Markdown dialect. Its attribute syntax
`{#id .class key=val}` is in fact the ancestor of GEML's. Pandoc's own
super-powers — multi-format conversion and programmable **Lua filters** — sit on
a different axis than the per-element comparison below.

A note on framing: this is **not** a checkbox race. AsciiDoc, in particular,
ships more built-in elements out of the box than GEML does. GEML's case rests on
three things no other format here offers together — and the comparison is meant
to make those visible, not to win a feature count:

1. **One primitive for every structured block** — lowest syntax surface to learn,
   parse, or *generate* (which is why it's friendly to AI).
2. **Build-time reference checking** — a broken cross-reference is an error, not a
   silent dead link — and it covers *content*, not just links: a transcluded
   block, an external CSV, a `.jsonl` log, a code line range.
3. **Self-contained version history** (`.gemlhistory`) — without git or any
   online service.

Legend: ✓ native · ◐ via extension/convention · ✗ none · *(H)* needs raw HTML.

For a construct-by-construct walk through **CommonMark 0.31.2** alone — every
leaf block, container block and inline, with what GEML does to each — see
[GEML vs. CommonMark](./commonmark.md).

The three bold rows are GEML's real differentiators. "Raw HTML = ✗" is a feature,
not a gap: it keeps semantics portable and tied to no backend. Pandoc Markdown is
the broadest column here — it adds citations, definition lists, and Lua filters —
yet it still lacks the one primitive, build-time checking, and self-contained
history.

## Side-by-side syntax

### Code block

```
GEML        === code {#hello lang=python}
            print("hi")
            ===
Markdown    ```python
            print("hi")
            ```
HTML        <pre><code class="language-python">print("hi")</code></pre>
CommonMark  ```python
            print("hi")
            ```
AsciiDoc    [source,python]
            ----
            print("hi")
            ----
Org-mode    #+begin_src python
            print("hi")
            #+end_src
Pandoc      ```{.python}
            print("hi")
            ```
```

### Document metadata

```
GEML        === meta
            title = "Budget plan"
            ===
Markdown    ---                 (YAML frontmatter — convention, not spec)
            title: Budget plan
            ---
HTML        <meta name="title" content="Budget plan">
CommonMark  (no mechanism)
AsciiDoc    = Budget plan
            :version: 0.1
Org-mode    #+TITLE: Budget plan
Pandoc      ---                 (YAML metadata block — first-class)
            title: Budget plan
            ---
```

### Admonition / callout

```
GEML        === note {#risks}
            Vendor lock-in is the main risk.
            ===
Markdown    > [!NOTE]            (GitHub extension)
            > Vendor lock-in is the main risk.
HTML        <div class="note">Vendor lock-in is the main risk.</div>
CommonMark  (no mechanism — plain blockquote only)
AsciiDoc    [NOTE]
            ====
            Vendor lock-in is the main risk.
            ====
Org-mode    (no standard — special block, export-dependent)
Pandoc      ::: {.note}
            Vendor lock-in is the main risk.
            :::
```

### Cross-reference, and whether it is checked

```
GEML        See [[#budget]]          → #budget missing ⇒ build ERROR
Markdown    See [budget](#budget)    → broken link passes silently
HTML        See <a href="#budget">…  → not checked
CommonMark  See [budget](#budget)    → not checked
AsciiDoc    See <<budget>>           → processor WARNS on unresolved xref
Org-mode    See [[budget]]           → partially checked on export
Pandoc      See [budget](#budget)    → not checked (xref via pandoc-crossref filter)
```

### Transclusion — content that lives in another document

```
GEML        === embed {src=handbook.geml#refund}
            ===                      → renders that block here. src= is
                                       reference-checked, a transclusion cycle
                                       is an error, and handbook.geml is PARSED
                                       AS ITS OWN DOCUMENT — its metadata and
                                       its relative paths resolve against
                                       itself, not against this file.
            Inline form:  ![[handbook.geml#refund]]  (inside a sentence)
Markdown    (no mechanism — Obsidian's ![[note]] is an app extension)
HTML        <iframe src="handbook.html#refund">   (a nested browsing context,
                                                   not content in this document)
CommonMark  (no mechanism)
AsciiDoc    include::handbook.adoc[tag=refund]    (preprocessor: the target's
                                                   TEXT is spliced in, and then
                                                   resolves against THIS file)
Org-mode    #+INCLUDE: "handbook.org::#refund" :only-contents t
Pandoc      (no native form — a filter, e.g. pandoc-include)
```

### Table with computed columns (GEML-specific)

```
GEML        === table {#fy25 format=csv header=1}
            Segment, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
            Cloud,   1,  2,  3,  4
            ===
            === view {#fy25-report src=#fy25
              compute="FY [%.1f] = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4"
              summary="Segment = 'Total'; FY = sum(FY)"}
            ===                       → per-row FY column + a Total summary row,
                                        FY shown to 1 decimal
Org-mode    | Segment | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | FY |
            |---------+----+----+----+----+----|
            #+TBLFM: $6=$2+$3+$4+$5    (the inspiration — but a full spreadsheet:
                                        cell refs, remote(), Emacs Lisp. GEML
                                        keeps a restricted column-formula subset)
others      static tables only — no computation
```

### Structured data, verified (GEML-specific)

```
GEML        === data {#limits format=json}
            { "retries": 3, "timeout_ms": 500 }
            ===                       → parsed and VERIFIED at build time; a
                                        malformed body is an error naming the
                                        offending line. #limits is addressable,
                                        referenceable and versioned like any
                                        other block.

            === data {#events format=jsonl src=events.jsonl}
            ===                       → the log stays a plain .jsonl file every
                                        existing tool can append to and tail;
                                        the document is its verified, chartable
                                        view. A body AND src= is an error —
                                        one source, always.
others      a ```json fence — text the processor never reads, never checks, and
            cannot address, reference or chart. HTML's
            <script type="application/json"> and Org's #+NAME'd src block come
            closest, and neither verifies the payload.
```

### Code that names its source, instead of copying it

```
GEML        === code {#parse lang=ts src=src/parser.ts#L14-24}
            ===                       → the block IS those lines. If the file no
                                        longer has them the build FAILS
                                        (bad-source-range); a body kept
                                        alongside src= is a snapshot, and warns
                                        when it has drifted from the source.
AsciiDoc    [source,ts]
            ----
            include::src/parser.ts[lines=14..24]
            ----                      → whatever sits at those lines today,
                                        silently — a drifted range is not an error
Org-mode    #+INCLUDE: "src/parser.ts" src ts :lines "14-25"   (same, at export)
Pandoc      ```{.ts include=src/parser.ts startLine=14 endLine=24}   (filter)
MD/HTML     copy-paste, and it rots
```

### Diagram (hosting an external DSL)

```
GEML        === diagram {#flow format=mermaid}
            graph LR
              A --> B
            ===
Markdown    ```mermaid             (GitHub renders it; no id/caption/check)
            graph LR
              A --> B
            ```
AsciiDoc    [mermaid]
            ----
            graph LR
              A --> B
            ----
Org-mode    #+begin_src plantuml :file out.png
            ...
            #+end_src
Pandoc      ```{.mermaid}          (rendered by a filter, e.g. mermaid-filter)
            graph LR
              A --> B
            ```
HTML/CMark  no native diagram hosting
```

### Chart bound to a table or a data block (GEML-specific)

```
GEML        === diagram {#rev format=geml-chart data=#fy25 type=bar x=Segment y=FY}
            ===                       → renders table #fy25 as a chart; column
                                        refs checked. data= takes the same three
                                        targets a table's src= does: a block in
                                        this document, doc.geml#id in another,
                                        or a file. A data block feeds a chart
                                        when its value is a record array.
others      hand-copy data into a chart lib, or a spreadsheet app — no link
```

## What only GEML does

Every format above can render a heading and a code block. The difference is what
happens to a *whole document* under change and automation:

- **A single typed block** carries code, tables, diagrams, math, callouts, and
  metadata — so there is one grammar to learn and one grammar for a tool (or an
  LLM) to emit correctly, instead of a different syntax per feature plus an HTML
  fallback.
- **References are validated at build time.** An `#id` that doesn't resolve fails
  the build, instead of slipping through as a dead link the way it does in
  Markdown/HTML.
- **Content may live elsewhere and still be checked.** An `embed` block (or an
  inline `![[…]]`) renders another document's block in place; `src=` gives a
  `code` block a line range in a real source file, a `table` its CSV, a `data`
  block its `.jsonl` log. Every named target is resolved at build time — a
  dangling reference, a transclusion cycle, and a line range that has drifted
  since the file changed all fail the build. AsciiDoc and Org-mode can include
  too, but they *splice text*: the target's own relative paths then resolve
  against whoever included it, and a stale line range yields the wrong lines
  quietly. In GEML the named document is parsed as a document in its own right,
  so it resolves against itself at every depth of the chain.
- **Data is verified, not quoted.** A `data` block carries JSON's value domain —
  scalars, sequences, maps — as data the build parses and *rejects when
  malformed*, where a ` ```json ` fence in every other format here is text nobody
  reads. It takes an `#id`, so it can be referenced, block-edited, versioned and
  charted; and with `src=events.jsonl` the records stay a plain append-and-tail
  file while the document becomes their verified view.
- **History is self-contained.** A sibling `.gemlhistory` file reconstructs any
  past revision and rolls the document back — offline, with no git and no online
  service. See the [history extension](https://github.com/geml-spec/geml/blob/main/spec/profiles/geml-history/geml-history-profile.md).

Pandoc plays a different game — it is the universal *converter*, and the most
practical way to reach `docx`/`latex`/`epub`. A natural future for GEML is to
*join* that ecosystem (a Pandoc reader/writer) rather than compete with it.

See the [core specification](https://github.com/geml-spec/geml/blob/main/spec/GEML-spec.md) for the full format, and the
[README](https://github.com/geml-spec/geml/blob/main/README.md) for a quick tour.
