// What a day of real document editing would have cost with GEML in the mix.
//
// Run from the site repository root, with a built geml checkout in GEML_SRC:
//   GEML_SRC=../geml node benchmarks/real-session-replay.mjs
//   GEML_SRC=../geml node benchmarks/real-session-replay.mjs --json
//
// The write-up is benchmarks/mixed-toolchain-cn.md (English: mixed-toolchain.md).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHERE THE TWO SIDES COME FROM
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The baseline is not a model. `real-session-edits.json` holds what one agent
// actually did while editing README_CN.md for a day, recovered from its session
// log: for every edit, the bytes it read to locate the place, how many calls
// that took, and the bytes of old text it had to quote to say where the change
// goes. The log stays private; that file is everything derived from it.
//
// The GEML side runs live, here, now. This script converts README_CN.md into
// GEML, then for each recovered edit searches for the text that edit landed and
// reads the block it lands in — `geml find` followed by `geml get`, both really
// executed, both charged in full.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE RULE FOR WHICH TOOL DOES WHICH EDIT — fixed before running
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Nothing here picks whichever tool turned out cheaper. The split is the
// agent's OWN choice, recorded at the time, and each side goes to the GEML verb
// built for that shape of work:
//
//   - Edits it made one at a time, after reading the text, go to `find` + `get`:
//     locate by content, read exactly the block.
//   - Edits it made as a batched replacement — several string swaps in one
//     script, because it already knew the exact old text — go to `replace`,
//     which needs no read at all.
//
// THE SECOND ROUTE IS NEW, and the reason this run differs from earlier ones.
// The rule used to leave batched edits on the original commands, because GEML
// had no verb for "the old text is already known"; `geml replace` is that verb,
// so the exception it was written for is gone.
//
// It also exposes something the old rule hid. "Blind replacement reads nothing"
// is not what the recorded day actually shows: of the nineteen batched edits,
// exactly one read nothing. The rest read a window first — the same window
// several times over, amortised across the swaps in one script — which is
// precisely the cost `replace` removes.
//
// An edit whose landed text is no longer in the document is dropped — it was
// superseded later in the same session, so NEITHER side could locate it.
